A simple program that calculates the percentage of words that you should already know from a given Japanese text.

This is based on the [Japanese Known Word Checker](https://github.com/krausekai/japanese-tools/tree/master/known-word-checker) with the main difference being that this is a CLI program instead of a website like the original.
